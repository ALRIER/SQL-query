Right joins arent as common as left joins. One reason why is that you can always write

--Well done! Now you know how to select single columns.

--In the real world, you will often want to select multiple columns. Luckily, SQL makes this really easy. To select multiple columns from a table, simply separate the column names with commas!

--For example, this query selects two columns, name and birthdate, from the people table:

--SELECT name, birthdate
--FROM people;
--Sometimes, you may want to select all columns from a table. Typing out every column name would be a pain, so there's a handy shortcut:

--SELECT *
--FROM people;
--If you only want to return a certain number of results, you can use the LIMIT keyword to limit the number of rows returned:

--SELECT *
--FROM people
--LIMIT 10;
--Before getting started with the instructions below, check out the column names in the films table!

--Get the title of every film from the films table.

--Get the title and release year for every film.

--Get the title, release year and country for every film.

--Get all columns from the films table.

SELECT title
from films;

--Often your results will include many duplicate values. If you want to select all the unique values from a column, you can use the DISTINCT keyword.

--This might be useful if, for example, you're interested in knowing which languages are represented in the films table:

--SELECT DISTINCT language
--FROM films;
--Remember, you can check out the data in the tables by clicking on the table name!

--Get all the unique countries represented in the films table.

--Get all the different film certifications from the films table.

--Get the different types of film roles from the roles table.

SELECT DISTINCT country
FROM films;

--As you've seen, COUNT(*) tells you how many rows are in a table. However, if you want to count the number of non-missing values in a particular column, you can call COUNT() on just that column.

--For example, to count the number of birth dates present in the people table:

--SELECT COUNT(birthdate)
--FROM people;
--It's also common to combine COUNT() with DISTINCT to count the number of distinct values in a column.

--For example, this query counts the number of distinct birth dates contained in the people table:

--SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT birthdate)
--FROM people;
--Let's get some practice with COUNT()!

--Count the number of rows in the people table.

--Count the number of (non-missing) birth dates in the people table.

--Count the number of unique birth dates in the people table.

--Count the number of unique languages in the films table.

--Count the number of unique countries in the films table.

SELECT COUNT(people)
FROM people;

--Simple filtering of numeric values
--As you learned in the previous exercise, the WHERE clause can also be used to filter numeric records, such as years or ages.

--For example, the following query selects all details for films with a budget over ten thousand dollars:

--SELECT *
--FROM films
--WHERE budget > 10000;
--Now it's your turn to use the WHERE clause to filter numeric values!

--Get all details for all films released in 2016.

--Get the number of films released before 2000.

--Get the title and release year of films released after 2000.

SELECT *
FROM films
WHERE release_year = 2016;

--Get all details for all French language films.

SELECT *
FROM films
WHERE language = 'French';

---Now you'll write a query to get the title and release year
-- of films released in the 90s which were in French or Spanish
--and which took in more than $2M gross.

SELECT title, release_year
FROM films
WHERE (release_year >= 1990 AND release_year < 2000)
AND (language = 'French' OR language = 'Spanish')
AND gross > 2000000

--BETWEEN (2)
--Similar to the WHERE clause, the BETWEEN clause can be used with multiple AND and OR operators, so you can build up your queries and make them even more powerful!

--For example, suppose we have a table called kids. We can get the names of all kids between the ages of 2 and 12 from the United States:

SELECT name
FROM kids
WHERE age BETWEEN 2 AND 12
AND nationality = 'USA';
--Take a go at using BETWEEN with AND on the films data to get the title and
--- release year of all Spanish language films released between 1990 and 2000
--- (inclusive) with budgets over $100 million. We have broken the problem into
-- smaller steps so that you can build the query as you go along!

SELECT title, release_year
FROM films
WHERE release_year BETWEEN 1990 AND 2000
AND budget > 100000000
AND (language = 'Spanish' OR language = 'French');


---Diagnosing problems using anti-join
--Another powerful join in SQL is the anti-join. It is particularly useful in identifying which records are causing an incorrect number of records to appear in join queries.

--You will also see another example of a subquery here, as you saw in the first exercise on semi-joins. Your goal is to identify the currencies used in Oceanian countries!

--Begin by determining the number of countries in countries that are listed in Oceania using SELECT, FROM, and WHERE.
-- Select statement
select count(*)
  -- From countries
  from countries
-- Where continent is Oceania
where continent = 'Oceania';

--SELECT ___.___, ___, ___ AS ___
--  FROM ___ AS ___
--   INNER JOIN ___ AS ___
--    ON ___.___ = ___.___
--WHERE ___.___ = ___;

-- Select fields (with aliases)
Select c1.code, name, basic_unit As currency
  -- From countries (alias as c1)
  from countries AS c1
  	-- Join with currencies (alias as c2)
  	inner join currencies AS c2
    -- Match on code
    ON c1.code = c2.code
-- Where continent is Oceania
Where c1.continent = 'Oceania';

--Note that not all countries in Oceania were listed in the resulting inner join with currencies. Use an anti-join to determine which countries were not included!

--Use NOT IN and (SELECT code FROM currencies) as a subquery to get the country code and country name for the Oceanian countries that are not included in the currencies table.

--SELECT ___, ___
--  FROM ___
--  WHERE ___ = ___
--      AND ___ NOT ___
--      (SELECT ___
--       FROM ___);

-- Select fields
select code, name
  -- From Countries
  FROM Countries
  -- Where continent is Oceania
  where continent = 'Oceania'

----------------------------Subquery inside select--------------------------
--In this exercise, you'll see how some queries can be written
--using either a join or a subquery.

--You have seen previously how to use GROUP BY with aggregate
--functions and an inner join to get summarized
--information from multiple tables.

--The code given in the first query selects the top nine
--countries in terms of number of cities appearing in the

--to get the same result as the provided code.

--Convert the GROUP BY code to use a subquery inside of SELECT by filling

---este que esta aqui abajo es el codigo que tengo que imitar.
/*
SELECT countries.name AS country, COUNT(*) AS cities_num

--------------------Subquery inside from-------------------

--Begin by determining for each country code how many languages

  	 FROM languages
  	 GROUP BY code) AS subquery
  WHERE countries.code = subquery.code
ORDER BY lang_num DESC;

-------------------Advanced subquery------------------------------------
--*You can also nest multiple subqueries to
--answer even more specific questions.

--*In this exercise, for each of the six continents listed in 2015,
--you'll identify which country had the maximum inflation rate,
--and how high it was, using multiple subqueries.
--*The table result of your final query should look something like
--the following, where anything between < > will
--be filled in with appropriate values:

--+------------+---------------+-------------------+
--| name       | continent     | inflation_rate    |
--|------------+---------------+-------------------|
--| <country1> | North America | <max_inflation1>  |
--| <country2> | Africa        | <max_inflation2>  |
--| <country3> | Oceania       | <max_inflation3>  |
--| <country4> | Europe        | <max_inflation4>  |
--| <country5> | South America | <max_inflation5>  |
--| <country6> | Asia          | <max_inflation6>  |
--+------------+---------------+-------------------+

--*Again, there are multiple ways to get to this solution using only
--joins, but the focus here is on showing you an introduction
--into advanced subqueries.

--*Create an INNER JOIN with countries on the left and economies
--on the right with USING, without aliasing your tables or columns.

--*Retrieve the country's name, continent, and inflation rate for 2015.

-- Select fields
SELECT countries.name, continent, inflation_rate
  -- From countries
  from countries
  	-- Join to economies
  	inner join economies
    -- Match on code
    USING (code)
-- Where year is 2015
Where year = 2015;

--*Select the maximum inflation rate in 2015 AS max_inf grouped by continent
--using the previous step's query as a subquery in the FROM clause.

--*Thus, in your subquery you should:
--*Create an inner join with countries on the left and economies on the right
--with USING (without aliasing your tables or columns).
--*Retrieve the country name, continent, and inflation rate for 2015.
--*Alias the subquery as subquery.
--*This will result in the six maximum inflation rates in 2015 for the six
--continents as one field table. Make sure to not include continent in the
--outer SELECT statement.


-- Select the maximum inflation rate as max_inf
Select max(inflation_rate) as max_inf
  -- Subquery using FROM (alias as subquery)
  FROM (
      SELECT name, continent, inflation_rate
      FROM countries
      INNER JOIN economies
      USING (code)
      WHERE year = 2015) AS subquery
-- Group by continent
GROUP BY continent;

--*Now it's time to append your second query to your first query
--using AND and IN to obtain the name of the country, its continent,
--and the maximum inflation rate for each continent in 2015.

--*For the sake of practice, change all joining conditions to use ON
--instead of USING.

-- Select fields
SELECT name, continent, inflation_rate
  -- From countries
  FROM countries
	-- Join to economies
	INNER JOIN economies
	-- Match on code

In this exercise, you will be creating a list of matches in the 2011/2012
  season where Barcelona was the home team. You will do this using a CASE
  statement that compares the values of two columns to create a new group
  -- wins, losses, and ties.

In 3 steps, you will build a query that identifies a match's winner,
  identifies the identity of the opponent, and finally filters for Barcelona
  as the home team. Completing a query in this order will allow you to watch
  your results take shape with each new piece of information.

The matches_spain table currently contains Barcelona's matches from the
  2011/2012 season, and has two key columns, hometeam_id and awayteam_id,
  that can be joined with the teams_spain table. However, you can only join
  teams_spain to one column at a time.

/*
Barcelona and Real Madrid have been rival teams for more than 80 years.
  Matches between these two teams are given the name El Clásico (The Classic).
  In this exercise, you will query a list of matches played between these two
  rivals.

You will notice in Step 2 that when you have multiple logical conditions in
  a CASE statement, you may quickly end up with a large number of WHEN clauses
  to logically test every outcome you are interested in. It's important to make
  sure you don't accidentally exclude key information in your ELSE clause.

In this exercise, you will retrieve information about matches played between
  Barcelona (id = 8634) and Real Madrid (id = 8633). Note that the query you
  are provided with already identifies the Clásico matches using a filter in
  the WHERE clause.

--------------------------Filtering your CASE statement----------------------

/*Let's generate a list of matches won by Italy's Bologna team! There are
  quite a few additional teams in the two tables, so a key part of generating
  a usable query will be using your CASE statement as a filter in the WHERE
  clause.

CASE statements allow you to categorize data that you're interested in -- and
exclude data you're not interested in. In order to do this, you can use a CASE
statement as a filter in the WHERE statement to remove output you don't want
to see.

Here is how you might set that up:

SELECT *
FROM table
WHERE
    CASE WHEN a > 5 THEN 'Keep'
         WHEN a <= 5 THEN 'Exclude' END = 'Keep';

In essence, you can use the CASE statement as a filtering column like any
other column in your database. The only difference is that you don't alias
the statement in WHERE.

Identify Bologna's team ID listed in the teams_italy table by selecting the
team_long_name and team_api_id. */

/*------------------  Calculating percent with CASE and AVG  ------------------

CASE statements will return any value you specify in your THEN clause.
This is an incredibly powerful tool for robust calculations and data
manipulation when used in conjunction with an aggregate statement.
One key task you can perform is using CASE inside an AVG function to calculate
a percentage of information in your database.

Here's an example of how you set that up:

AVG(CASE WHEN condition_is_met THEN 1
         WHEN condition_is_not_met THEN 0 END)

With this approach, it's important to accurately specify which records count
as 0, otherwise your calculations may not be correct!
